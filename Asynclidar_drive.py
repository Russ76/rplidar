This is an example of a multithreading Lidar-reading program that drives a rover via the PyCommandMessanger messaging library.
It uses an event-driven hardware abstraction architectre, where the events in this case are detected obstacles or timers, and the
messaging library provides the hardware abstraction. It requires Python 3.5 or above. To install that on RaspberryPi, follow these
instructions: http://bohdan-danishevsky.blogspot.com/2017/01/building-python-360-on-raspberry-pi-3.html
